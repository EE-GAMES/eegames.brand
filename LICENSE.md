# Brand Identifier Authorization Agreement

## Definitions
The "Brand Identifiers" referred to in this Agreement include, but are not limited to, any of the following that are owned by the Licensor or that the Licensor has the authority to license: company names, trade names, logos, trademarks, service marks, domain names, specific color schemes, fonts, visual design elements, brand slogans, taglines, mascots, and any other unique identifiers associated with the brand. The Licensor reserves the right to update the list of Brand Identifiers at any time.

## Scope and Nature of License
1. **Default Status**: All Brand Identifiers are provided on an "All Rights Reserved" basis. No organization or individual may use the Brand Identifiers in any way without a separate written authorization agreement from the Licensor.

2. **Limited License**: This Agreement only becomes effective when the Licensor has explicitly granted a specific authorization to the Licensee in written form. The license granted herein is revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, and non-sublicensable, and is strictly limited to the purpose, media, time, and territory expressly specified in the written authorization letter.

3. **Prerequisite of Written Authorization**: Prior to any use of the Brand Identifiers, the Licensee must submit a detailed usage plan (including, but not limited to, purpose, scenario, format, duration, etc.) to the Licensor and obtain the Licensor's written approval. Any use without such prior written approval shall constitute a breach of this Agreement and an infringement of rights.
